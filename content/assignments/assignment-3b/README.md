## BC Liquor Shiny App

You may modify this README accordingly to the instructions from assignment 3B, *including* modifying the title of the README to be the name of your app instead of the current "Welcome to your Assignment 3B!".

Click [here](https://sezar543.shinyapps.io/bcl-shiny/) to see the URL where the app is hosted.

For this assignment, *Option A - BC Liquor app* is selected. I implemented the following features:
1) shinyjs::colourInput()  is used so that the user can choose the colors of bars, *red* and *whine*, on the plot.
2) Image of a BC liquor store is included on the titlePanel using *img(src = " ")*.
3) The ouputs *text results*, *plot* and *table* are placed on separate tabs.

### Acknowledgements
+ The BC Liquor app was created by [Dean Attali](deanattali.com), and was copied into the folder "BCL-Shiny" in this repo from Dean's [bcl folder](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/tree/master/bcl) in his [shiny-server](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server) repo.
